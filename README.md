# Big Data Analytics Project - University of Pisa
This is the project of <a href="http://didawiki.di.unipi.it/doku.php/bigdataanalytics/bda/start">Big Data Analytics course </a>

The aim of the project is to make a binary classification on an unbalanced dataset with minority class as the fraudulent accounts, trying to understand if some of the attributes could be useful in determining whether an account has made fraudulent transactions or not, using different classification methods on different datasets.
<ol>
  <li>On the first midterm, the data understanding and exploration phase has been conducted. </li>
  <li>On the second midterm, the best model has been chosen based on the performance. Imbalanced Learning is carried out to see if a balanced dataset could improve the classification.Then Pattern Mining is performed to extract rules that could give useful information about the fraudolent accounts.</li>
  <li>On the third midterm, SHAP explainer is used to explore how the dataset's features contribute to the classification, especially if they identify the class as a fraud, so if an account has made fraudulent transactions.</li>
</ol>
